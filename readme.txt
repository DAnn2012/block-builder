Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg, officially created by Elementor Page Builder, allows you to easily insert any Elementor template into Gutenberg.

== Description ==

Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg, officially created by **[Elementor Page Builder](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=block-builder&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)**, allows you to easily insert any Elementor template into Gutenberg with just one click.

This plugin is the smartest way to combine Elementor & Gutenberg to incorporate more advanced layouts into Gutenberg.
